# Hollow Stomach
A *Hollow Knight* mod to make it more like *Hungry Knight*.

## Installation
Drag ```HollowStomach.dll``` to the mods folder of your Hollow Knight installation. *Hollow Stomach* requires the Modding API to function.

## Gameplay
- Hitting enemies no longer gives the Knight SOUL.
- SOUL constantly drains at a rate of 3.3 every second.
- If your SOUL runs out, you start to *starve*. Every 2 seconds, you take 1 damage.
- Picking up any Geo grants the Knight 33 SOUL.
- Geo pickups have a chance to be rare *purple Geo* pickups, which increase your movement speed and prevent SOUL drain for 6 seconds.

### Quality of Life
- SOUL drain does not take effect until you first pick up Geo.
- If you are in a dream sequence or the Abyss, SOUL does not drain, though if you are out of SOUL you still are subject to starvation.
- Being within range of a Bench causes the Knight's SOUL to regenerate.
- You can shake down bosses for their pocket change. 
- Works with any Custom Knight skin.

### Future Plans
- Ensure that True Ending is possible.
- Ensure that every boss properly drops Geo.
- Get this in the Mod Installer.
- Figure out how to get around the Geo restrictions in Godhome.
- Make Soul Catcher/Eater actually do something.
